Richard Owen coined the modern definition of homology in 1843.

Richard Owen compared extant vertebrates and fossils, and coined this term to explain repeating patterns found in animals

## Similarity and homology

<i class="fa fa-warning"></i> These two terms are often confused, e.g.:

> "_the sequences are 50% homologous_"

> "_these two sequences are highly homologous_"

- **Homology** is a **categorical** term: either two sequences are homologous or not
- **Similarity** is a **quantitative** term, resulting from comparing two sequences (sequence *identity*)

--

<br>

- We use similarity as a proxy of homology: if two sequences are significantly similar, we assume they are homologous

--

- When we calculate the similarity between two sequences, we need some sort of **statistics** to measure similarity (e.g., whether sequences are very similar or really different/result by chance)

### Scoring an alignment

Maximize matches, minimize gaps
  - Simplest scoring:
    - Each match receives a score
    - Mismatches receive a lower score than matches between identical residues
    - Gaps receive penalties

--

**Example scoring**:
- Match: +2
- Mismatch: 0
- Gap: -1

### Number of possible alignments

The number of possible alignments is staggering! For two sequences of length $n$ and $m$, respectively, the number of possible alignments is:

.pull-left[
$$
A(n,m)=\frac{(n+m)!}{m!k!}\approx\frac{2^{2n}}{2\times\pi\times n}
$$
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo = F, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
library(ggplot2)

# función número de alineamientos para secuencias de igual longitud
A <- function(n) {
  factorial(2*n) / (factorial(n)^2)
}

# datos como en el gráfico (longitudes pequeñas)
df <- data.frame(
  n = 1:10,
  alignments = A(1:10)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x = n, y = alignments)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(
    x = "Length of one sequence",
    y = "Number of alignments"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18)

```

### Protein scoring

- Protein alignments use a scoring system based on frequencies of aminoacid substitutions in related proteins
- Default scoring matrix is **BLOSUM62**

.pull-left[
<img src="img/blosum62.png" >
]

--

.pull-right[
- Frequently seen substitutions get positive scores
- Rarely seen substitutions get negative scores
- Substitutions expected by chance get a 0
- Self-matches scores:
  - Common aminoacids (e.g. A, I, L, V) have lower scores
  - Rare amino acids (e.g., W) and those with special roles (e.g. P) have higher scores

### E-value

> **Expectaction value**: the number of sequences that would be expected to have that score (or higher) if the query sequence were compared against a database containing unrelated sequences

$$
E=m·n·2^-S'
$$

where $S'$ is a normalized score and $m$ and $n$ are the sequence lengths.

- Ranges from zero to >10
- The E-value is highly dependent on database 



---
class: animated, fadeIn

## Other aspects in BLAST searches:

- **E-value depends on database size**:
  - Larger databases → higher chance of random matches
  - The same alignment can have different E-values in different databases
  - Important when locally searching in small databases
  
- **Low-complexity filtering**:
  - Mask highly repetitive sequences 
  - Prevents spurious high-scoring matches between unrelated sequences
  - Example: proline-rich regions (`PPPAPPPGPPPPPPAPP`)
  
- **Why multiple HSPs can occur in a hit?**
  - BLAST is a local alignment tool
  - A sequence may share several independent matching regions
  - Each region is reported as a separate High-scoring Segment Pair (HSP)
  
- **Issues with multi domain proteins**:
  - Matches may reflect a shared domain, not full-protein homology

## Orthology and Paralogy

---

class: animated, fadeIn

## Definitions: gene trees evolve inside a species tree

<center>
<img src="img/tree1.png" width=75%> 
</center>

--

- A species tree is effectively a tree of divergence times
- Within the species tree evolve gene trees

---

Original definition of orthology and paralogy by Walter Fitch (1970,
Systematic Zoology 19:99-113):
"Where the homology is the result of gene duplication so that both
copies have descended side by side during the history of an
organism, (for example, alpha and beta hemoglobin) the genes
should be called paralogous (para = in parallel).
Where the homology is the result of speciation so that the history
of the gene reflects the history of the species (for example alpha
hemoglobin in man and mouse) the genes should be called
orthologous (ortho = exact)."

---

Example of globin genes


---

As a corollary:
-	Orthology definition is purely on evolutionary terms (nor functional, not synteny, …)
-	There is no limit on the number of orthologs or paralogs that a given gene can have (when more than one ortholog exists, there is nothing such as “true ortholog”) – this is particularly problematic when the gene of interest in humans has two orthologs in mouse, for example, and knocking out one may give misleading results
-	Many-to-many orthology relationships do exist (co-orthology)
-	There is no limit on how ancient/recent is the ancestral relationship of orthologs and paralogs
-	Orthology is non-transitive (as opposed to homology)


---

Are these sentences correct? T/F game in wooclap

- Orthologs are homologous genes that have the same function
- Orthologs are homologous genes in different species, while
paralogs are homologous genes in the same species
- The ortholog is the most similar sequence among the
homologs in another species
- If gene A is orthologous to gene B, and gene B is orthologous
to gene C, then A and C are orthologous to each other.
- Orthologs are genes that do not duplicate and, when they exist,
they are always present in single copy
- After a duplication, the orthologous copy is the one that keeps
the function of the ancestral gene

---

Why predicting orthology is important?
 Important implications for phylogeny: only sets of
orthologous genes are expected to reflect the underlying
species evolution (although there are many exceptions)
 The most exact way of comparing two (or more) genomes in
terms of their gene content. Necessary to uncover how
genomes evolve.
 Implications for functional inference: orthologs, as compared
to paralogs, are more likely to share the same function

---

goblin example: tree

---

tree non-orthologous: not a species tree

---

-	Because it is the most exact way of comparing two (or more) genomes in term of their gene content, necessary to uncover how genomes evolved.

Comparative genomics rests on comparison of “equivalent” genes, which is more precise when considering homology and paralogy. There is an ancient speciation, a gene duplication, and then a more recent speciation. 

Only by resolving orthology relationships we can figure out the relationship. It is not that the frog lost one human gene, it is that both human genes have the same relationship with the frog gene.

 Implications for functional inference: orthologs, as compared
to paralogs, are more likely to share the same function
REALLY???, IS THIS TRUE IF SO, WHY IS THAT?

However, is this necessarily true? And if so, why? Reflecting on the process of gene evolution, when a gene duplicates there is redundancy in the genome. This is not necessarily an advantage: in the end, it is not what a genome wants to accommodate, and what is more common is that one of the copies eventually degrades into a pseudogene via a deleterious mutation. However, if mutations inactivate different functions in the different copies, the two genes are necessary to maintain the full function, and the two genes are retained (this process is called sub-functionalization). If, instead, one of the copies acquires a new function (neo-functionalization) this second copy may also be kept.

After duplication: diversify or die (neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization models)
